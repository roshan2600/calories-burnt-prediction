# Insurance Price Prediction

The prediction for Insurance premium works as follows. You have some features/input (age, gender, smoking, etc.) which go into the training process. These features can determine how high or low is the premium amount. For example, the younger people are less likely to need medical care, so their premiums are generally cheaper, and the premium is higher for smokers. The Label/Output is the Premium/Price that you want to predict, which is the outcome of calling the Machine Learning Model.
